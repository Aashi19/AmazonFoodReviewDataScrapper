    Not Your Mom’s Sewing Kit!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  I keep finding these cookies in huge tins in other stores. I love these cookies, but not 3lbs worth. I was happy to find a smaller tin of these lightly sweet and buttery cookies. I was concerned to order them from Amazon based on other reviews saying that their cookies arrived broken and in pieces. I took a chance and ordered them. To my surprise, even though the box was delivered on its side that all the cookies were in tact! They are as delicious as I remembering them being. Maybe when I’m finished with them, I can use the tin as a sewing kit like my mother did. Now I can disappoint my children the way my mother did growing up.

  I remember as a child my grandparents always had Royal Dansk Danish Cookie Selection on hand for the holidays. I loved every single one of them and could never stop eating them.  Years later, I once purchased an extra large tin and ate them in a few days.  I haven't had these for several years now, however I believe they must have changed the recipe as they don't have the same texture and irresistible flavor.  They are still good but lacking.  They did arrive in perfect condition and very fresh but do wish they also arrived with the same recipe.

  My Grandma used to buy these for us and give it with our Christmas gift, they're so simple yet so tasty and there's so many for the price. My favorite ones are the Pretzel looking ones with bits and pieces of chunky pieces of Sugar. They're fun to eat so if you're not careful you'll be watching TV and eating them and in 20 minutes you'll look down to realize there's barely left LOL.

  I remember having these way back when I was a kid so I was pretty happy when I saw these were still around.  They still have the sugar topping on them and there are a few different shapes.  To me not all of them taste the same. Don't know if that was intentional...The larger tin is a great deal. I just bought the small tin because I wanted to try them out again.

Her mom used to make her these little butter cookies. And she loves them just a little aid in my head shipped to her to send a little love. So easy to ship and you don’t have to fight the crowds to make somebody’s day a little better.

  Absolutely the best cookies ever! They taste delicious and is a favorite in our family. A few arrived broken but that’s to be expected when you get them delivered! I break them anyway when I’m eating them because you’d look like a pig if you crammed a whole one in your mouth lol. If you want unbroken cookies, get off the couch and buy these at your local grocery store instead of getting them delivered or stop complaining! Definitely will purchase these again!

I remember being unhappy when I was expecting cookies but finding needles, threads etc.  Now,  I associate the tin only with sewing materials and I'm startled to find cookies in them!I do love the cookies but these are not as buttery as I remember.  Not sure if its a function of my memory or the formula.

I really like that they're made with clean ingredients. I'm glad I can purchase them on Amazon. I HIGHLY recommend them.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

  I’ve purchased and enjoyed Royal Dansk butter cookies for decades, but I’ve always purchased them in a store rather than online.  The cookies were broken and tasted stale although they hadn’t come close to the Use By/Best By date.  That left me wondering if these were even the genuine article.  There are, after all, so many inferior knock offs on the shelves.  Needless to say, I went back to buying my Royal Dansk in a store.  They were not broken and had the delicate fresh buttery taste I know and love.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  To my surprise, there are actual cookies in the tin and not just sewing supplies. After realizing my whole childhood was a lie, I consoled myself with a handful of these delicious sweets (mainly the pretzel ones, because even though they're all the same flavor, these are objectively just better) and a few days later, the tin was empty. I then transferred my loose sewing supplies into the tin so that I can prepare to deceive any future innocent grandchildren who come to visit and think that I have sweets, only to be disappointed when they find needles and thread. Would highly recommend if you, like me, are trying to relive the glory days of deceitful cookie tins and grabbing this iconic blue tin when you needed to patch that whole in your pants.

  Imagine what it would look like if a truck ran over the tin.  Ordered several - they were utterly destroyed.  Squashed in and dented.  Can't even open one to get to the crumbs inside.When I tried to return or exchange, Amazon's only option was to ""call"".So I stupidly did.  Automated b.s. and a waste of time.So maybe don't waste your time on these here.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  The last time i come to in this was at a riteAid. 2 for $6, decent packaging in a box, nice demo figures. No reason to reject such a deal.That cant wait to get home and open the box and have the very first bite, however, was totally a different story. It tasted like stale, and hints of other unpleasantness in it. I looked at the exp. date and it was still well before the last date. But not a freshly fresh date either. So i took it, they were on sale for some reason, or another.Now it's probably 5 years passed. One evening just like all others, i sat at the desk and found this, 'ROYAL DANSK butter cookies', all of a sudden on my side. It feels like memory-twisted and deja vu. Like you throw something away and it stubbornly won't leave you and come back, making you think you are in a time or space of distortion. Obviously it was purchased by the other one in this house. I remember nothing but the not-so-good experience with this, not the taste, but the feeling only. So why not give it another try, for things changed so fast, trump came and left, covid came and stays forever, during this five years.It was not a bad one though, pretty much in the level with average baking American families'. Yet i can still tell this is something from Royal Dansk, since all those typical taste and unpleasant vibes, old and new, still remains. I double checked that it was 'made in danmark'. But I don't understand why it must always come with a hint of bitterness, even if just a tiny bit. The other reviewer was really cool though, as is always can't tell any difference for anything.If you really enjoy butter cookies, try some K or D brands with a few more bucks. But hear me not if this is just your go-to favorite.

  I’ve always loved these buttery, melt-in-your-mouth Danish cookies, which always seem to abound in workplaces throughout America around the holidays. Since I no longer work, I had to supply myself with these!  They are the same as always. So good! IN FACT, THEY HELPED ME GAIN 5 LBS THIS LAST MONTH!! Yes, they forced their way into my closed and resisting mouth!I tried another brand of Danish cookies and was terribly disappointed. I’m sorry, Royal Dansk, and I will remain true to you for the rest of my days!

  I had ordered 4 and it was placed sideways perfectly into a box. None of them were anywhere near expiration date. All the cookies were in great shape after I had opened one of them. Two of the boxes were given away as small gifts to family members and they enjoyed them.I have a Costco card so why buy this? The Costco mega box makes you get sick of it if you are eating as a single person. Second, I know that the other boxes will stay fresh while I am working on one of them. Third, you get several sewing containers instead of one large one.

  I have ate these many times in the past, however this was my time ordering them online, and the taste was just horrendous. There was absolutely no flavor, just a little bit of salt on bland baked dough. It was really disappointing, especially because the cookies looked very good appearance-wise. Perhaps even worse than that was their lack of freshness. The cookies were rather hard and stale, and didn't seem like they normally have in the past for me at all.

  I ordered these because I enjoyed them long ago, and I've been wanting a snack that isn't so overpoweringly sweet as so many others are.  That part is still true, but I these seemed to have an off-putting ""cardboard"" taste and not a trace of vanilla nor much of a buttery flavor.  I note that the ingredients list:  butter (milk) as the 2nd ingredient:  does that mean ""buttermilk"" ?  Coconut is listed, but I couldn't detect it.  Disappointing, but maybe they were always this way and just seemed better in remembrance . . . on the plus side, the freshness date was fine (to December 2021), and none of the cookies were broken.

  These cookies are delicious!  I’ve ordered them before and they came well packed.  NOT this time.  I ordered six tins.  When they arrived there were six tins bouncing around in a large cardboard bow.  One strip of four packing air-pillows was in the box.  Three of the four pillows were not inflated.  Cookies are a mess of crumbs.  I opened one tin...I’m assuming the other five are in the same condition.  Some of these were supposed to be gifts.  Whomever packed this box needs a lesson in packing.  Very disappointed!

    Nostalgic Cookies Deliver on Taste
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Many people will likely recognize these danish butter cookies by Royal Dansk in the bold blue tin. Like many  others, I have fond memories of eating these as a child. My parents would often get these metal tins of cookies as gifts from friends, and once opened, they would leave them on the kitchen sideboard for family members to snack on. I was pleased to see that only one cookie was broken when I opened the first tin, so that seems reasonable to me, given that they had to be shipped, stored, then shipped again. The variety of shapes is good, and the cookies were all fresh, crisp and buttery tasting, with that hint of sugar I remember. Delivery was fast, the items were well packed, and the price per tin seems more than reasonable. I would definitely recommend these if you are in the mood for a sweet taste of nostalgia.

  Currently helping lower the curve while I make mine bigger :/ I'm gonna weigh a quaranTON by the time this pandemic is over. Aside from that, the only caveat I have is that one can came a little dented, but that didn't warrantee a star deduction. The contents were perfectly fine and fresh. I found just a few cookies broken out of two tins and it wasn't crumbs. While I know these are sold in the dollar stores sometimes, the slightly heightened price is worth the convenience.  Nice little nostalgic snack that brings you back to better times. Thank you. :)

  To be honest i love these cookies. But the company has been slipping for quite some time, i had an incident where i bought a pack of these, and it was missing over half of the cookies, more like 3 quarters of the cookies were not packaged, than theres others that show up completely burnt to a crisp and taste absolutely awful. Than other times where they show up like a worker just threw a bumch of crushed up cookies into the slits. Ive decided to try buying 1 more and to no surprise they shown up burnt and tasting like crud. This is a company problem, as i tried reaching out to the company about 3 quarters of the cookies missing, gave them all the information, they said they were going to refund and investigate and after that they stopped replying to me and no refund in site. As much as i loved these cookies and my kid and the kids i babysit, i will no longer be buying these until the company gets their crud together and start taking pride into their product again. I highly suggest you to spend less money on a safer cookie, or even make your own.

  It must be this brand because Danish Butter Cookies are delicious. This brand is so cheap they don't even sprinkle sugar on the cookies, its just bland, non-buttery tasting cookies. We tried 2 and couldn't eat further. No recommended at all. I should have realized for this price I'm not getting Kjedelsen Butter Cookie quality.

  Before this horrendous Covid-19 Virus Crisis I used to purchase all my favorite cookies at the big box stores; however, I now order just about everything on line, which I found to be convenient and for the most part very quick service.I recently ordered this wonderful product (Royal Dansk Danish Butter Cookie selection in a 12 oz. can) for a bargain price ($2.78) on Amazon.  I was pleased with the quick service receiving this product in just a few days.I found these sugar cookies to be fresh and delicious. I love dunking them in my coffee.If you like these quality Danish butter cookies you may want to check them out on Amazon.Rating: 5 Stars.  Joseph J.

  These are delicious cookies.  All are butter cookies, but come with mildly different flavors and shapes--some with sugar toppings.  The tin that the cookies come in is sturdy and nice looking, making it appropriate to put out at a party or give to friends as a gift.  The tin can also be used for storage of small items after the cookies are finished.  These cookies are worth the price--try them--you won't be sorry.

  Why do I give out 4 stars: because these cookies are GREAT or because they give AS DESCRIBED? Well, I like them. Today I see there are much greater ones. 5*.. 3*? They are EXACTLY AS THEY USED TO, so 5*. I wish better ones, that’s how 3*, yet: I WOULD ORDER THESE DANISH COOKIES AGAIN.. for 3$.. = 5*.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  These danish cookies are one of our favorite but sometimes that too much milky & butter flavors keeps me away from eating more.- These taste great- Super packaging- Reasonable priced- Fresh and very flavorful- Sweet but not over doneRecommended to everyone to try at least once.
